# Genz.ad

This is the official README file for the Genz.ad Project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Figma Design
[View the Figma design here](https://www.figma.com/design/WQT88LFkfo65NqDHng2Kyd/New-AI-Ads-Gen?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=2jDnxBFVTgA56yiY-0)

## Getting Started
We are making use of pnpm so if you are not familiar with it or haven't heard it before, chances are you don't have it installed

Install using:
```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Form Validation
For the Newsletter section, a simple form validation should be implemented using react form hooks or zod

### Design Implementation
Create PIXEL PERFECT DESIGNS, it can not be iterated enough!!

## Team Instructions: Using PRs for Genz.ad frontend Development
As a team lead, I want to ensure our code meets high standards before merging to the main branch of the adgen-ai-frontend repository. Follow these these steps to work on your allocated tasks, show your progress, and get my approval:

### 1. Clone the Repository to your PC
Go to the adgen-ai-frontend repository on GitHub https://github.com/hngprojects/AI-Ad-Gen-Frontend/

Click the Fork button in the top-right corner.

Choose your personal GitHub account to create a fork ([Genz.ad repo](https://github.com/hngprojects/AI-Ad-Gen-Frontend/)).

Open a terminal and clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hngprojects/AI-Ad-Gen-Frontend/edit/main/README.md
cd adgen-ai-frontend
```


### 2. Create a Feature Branch in the repo
For an allocated task (e.g., "Implement Header with Navigation"), create a branch for it

```bash
git checkout -b feature/header-navigation
```

Name your branch descriptively (e.g., feature/your-issue-title).

### 3. Develop Your Code
Work on your component or section in this branch.

Use Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS as outlined in the issue.

Ensure your code:
Matches the Adgen-ai Figma design, make pixel perfect design

Uses TypeScript for type safety.

Leverages Shadcn UI components (e.g., Button, Card) with Tailwind styling.

Is responsive (works on mobile, tablet, desktop).

Follows Next.js conventions (e.g., src/components/, src/pages/).

Test locally with npm run dev and check for console errors.

### 4. Commit and Push to the branch you created
Commit frequently with clear messages:
```bash

git add .
git commit -m "feat(header): Implement navigation with logo and links"
```

Push to your branch(not the main repo):
```bash

git push origin feature/header-navigation
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request (PR) to the Main Repository
Go to your fork on GitHub, click Pull requests → New pull request.

Select your branch (e.g., feature/header-navigation) and compare it with the main repo’s main branch (e.g., yourusername/adgen-ai-frontend:main).

Title the PR: "feat: Implement Header with Navigation" (match the issue title).

In the description, include:
A link to the issue (e.g., #1 for Issue 1).

A summary of changes (e.g., "Added Header component with sticky navigation, responsive design, and Tailwind styling").


Click Create pull request.

### 6. Notify Me for Review
I’ll review the code, check the design match, and ensure it is good to go.


### 7. Wait for My Approval
I’ll review the PR, focusing on:
Code quality (TypeScript, linting, formatting).

Good commit messages [Check here to learn about writing good commit messages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/)

Design accuracy (Figma match, responsiveness).

Functionality (no errors, interactive states work).

Once approved, I’ll merge the PR into main.
